## Description
Golden Pickaxe MT5 is a high-performance forex trading software designed specifically for gold (XAU) trading. It offers multiple trading systems to cater to different risk preferences and market conditions. The expert advisor is developed by an independent team at Forex Robot Easy.

## Product Features
- Multiple Trading Systems: The expert advisor offers five different trading systems to choose from, including XAU Risky, XAU Balanced, XAU Classic, XAU Risky Vol, and XAU Balanced Vol.
- Neural Network Training: The software allows for the retraining of the Neural Network based on the broker's data, enabling it to adapt to changing market conditions.
- News and Stock Market Crash Filter: The expert advisor includes a filter to eliminate irrelevant market events, such as news and stock market crashes, to improve trading accuracy.
- Customizable Parameters: Users can customize the input parameters to adjust the trading system selection and enable/disable features like Neural Network training and news filtering.

## How It Works
The Golden Pickaxe MT5 expert advisor executes trades based on the selected trading system. The main program consists of the following steps:

1. Neural Network Retraining (if enabled): If the Neural Network training feature is enabled, the expert advisor calls the `RetrainNeuralNetwork` function to retrain the Neural Network using the broker's data.

2. News and Stock Market Crash Filtering (if enabled): If the News and Stock Market Crash Filter feature is enabled, the expert advisor calls the `FilterNewsAndStockMarketCrash` function to filter out irrelevant market events.

3. Trading System Execution: Based on the selected trading system, the expert advisor calls the corresponding trade execution function. For example, if the trading system is set to 0, the `TradeXAU_Risky` function is called.

4. Trade Execution Functions: The expert advisor includes separate trade execution functions for each trading system. These functions contain the specific code for executing trades based on the selected system's strategy.

## Usage
To use the Golden Pickaxe MT5 expert advisor, follow these steps:

1. Set the desired input parameters:
   - `TradingSystem`: Select the desired trading system (0-4).

   - `EnableNewsFilter`: Enable/disable News Filter (true/false).
